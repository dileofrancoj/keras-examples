#  Discussion:,,,
#,,,
#    The systolic blood pressure was measured for 30 people of,,,
#    different ages.  A nonzero intercept seems appropriate,,,
#    here, since even a very young person can have a high blood pressure.,,
#,,,
#    There are 30 rows of data.  The data columns include:,,,
#,,,
#      I,  the index,,
#      A0,1,,
#      A1, the age,,
#      B,  the systolic blood pressure,,
#,,,
#    We seek a model of the form:,,,
#,,,
#      B = A0 * X0 + A1 * X1,,,
